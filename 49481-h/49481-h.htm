<p class="description">SCENE I.—<i>A view by a river side; on the opposite bank are seen
the backs of houses—immersed in water, as at Blackwall, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>T<small>OM</small>, <i>with a large hamper,
</i><small>L</small>. <small>H</small>.</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. Come, this will do; though its utility exceeds its beauty; a
confoundedly ugly basket, though destined to hold most rare contents: several sugar
loaves, a canister of tea—black and green, almonds and raisins in abundance, coffee, rice,
and spices, bars of soap, starch and powder, blue enough to stock a small shop. Dear
Fanny! if her heart is not won by such a store of valuables, it is indeed hard.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>R<small>ECKLESS</small>, <small>L</small>.
<small>H</small>.</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. Ha, ha, ha, I’ve found her—What you here?</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. I have found her, I’ll tell you; congratulate your fortunate
master, most faithful Thomas.</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. Have you indeed found Miss Julia, and how?</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. Simply saw her at a house window.</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. But you cannot get into that house.</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. No; but I have got my mark, the means of hitting that mark are
still in fortune’s hands.</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. And in worse hands they could not be; sir, do give up this scheme.
You fall in love with a young lady at a boarding school, correspond with her under a
feigned name—</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. Yes, you know that arose from the fear of my cousin, old
Guineamore, hearing of these matters. I dared not trust my own lady love. You are aware I
have immense expectations from him, and that he hates anything like adventures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. Yes, and Reginald de Mowbray is a much prettier name than Ralph
Reckless, but where was I? Oh, a feigned name. Well, the young lady’s governess finds out
the correspondence, and very properly sends her to her guardians, who takes her into the
country, also very properly; give up this scheme, sir—</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. Not I; when I have found the retreat of my charmer, the cavern
where the treasure is hid, shall I be craven knight enough to fear the dragon that guards
it? No, man, not I—so if you have not better advice to give, we’ll change the subject.
What the devil is that great basket for?</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. What? oh, that is an affair of the heart; you have confided all
your tender secrets to me, therefore I will do the same to you, sir, if you will allow
me.</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. Certainly, good Thomas, go on.</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. Why, a sort of a relation of mine—a grocer, died the other day,
without a will, and his stock in trade got divided among six of us. I have borrowed this
large crate from Delfs, the crockery-warehouseman, to stow my share in; and am thinking I
could not do the genteel thing better, (as my sweetheart Fanny’s in service, and has to
find such articles out of her wages,) than to make her a delicate present of the
groceries, to sweeten my progress in her affections—eh, sir?</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. Delicate indeed! that I should have so gallant a man in my
service; and where does this happy maiden reside?</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. You see that white house, the other side of the water? one of those
houses in the water.</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. What! the white one?</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. Yes, she is housemaid there.</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. Oh! ha, ha, ha! Ri tol de rol. (<i>dances.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. Hey day. Did you tell me to order a straight waistcoat, sir?</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. No! tol de rol, I have a thought—</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. Why, you do look remarkable thoughtful.</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. You see these three bright gold sovereigns?</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. Yes, sir! perhaps you will allow me to <i>feel</i> them too?</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. So I will, Tom, on one condition! send <i>me</i> in <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span>that basket instead of the
grocery, and carry me to the house where my Julia is secluded.</p>

<p>T<small>OM</small>. Well, sir, but what will Fanny say?</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. Never mind her, there shall be a genteel note pinned outside the
basket, explaining the contents. Then, I’ll give her a couple of sovereigns, so pack up
and be gone.</p>

<p class="description">SCENE II.—<i>A parlour.—In centre of stage a sofa, capable of being
made into a bed. At the back a globe, covered with a glazed cover. A dining table and
chair. A cupboard to open at top and bottom, </i><small>R</small>.—<i>A large window to
open, </i><small>L</small>.</p>

<p class="direction">(M<small>RS</small>. F<small>ACILE</small>, <i>with a pestle and
mortar, and </i>J<small>ULIA</small>, <small>R</small>. <small>H</small>.,
<i>discovered.</i></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. Really, my dear, the best advice I can give you, is to employ
yourself about something, it will divert your mind.</p>

<p>J<small>ULIA</small>. Divert? I don’t want to be diverted, I want to be miserable; it’s
very unkind of you to try to console me.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. I can only say I mean well, and I believe your guardian means
well.</p>

<p>J<small>ULIA</small>. Yes, so is every horrid thing <i>meant</i> well. Our governess
used to make us wash our hands in icy water in winter, and tell us it was all for our
good. I hate what is for our good.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. But consider the impropriety of your forming at school, a
clandestine attachment with a young gentleman, of whose very residence you are
ignorant.</p>

<p>J<small>ULIA</small>. And what is propriety? A creature of imagination, framed by old
maids under the inspiration of green tea.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. Stop, stop—</p>

<p>J<small>ULIA</small>. Oh, what times were those, when I used to look for a note from
Mowbray, in the key hole of the green gate, when I used to read it to six especial
confidants, who were all dying with envy; ’till one quarrelled <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span>with me about a slice of my last cake,
betrayed me to the French teacher, who told the head teacher, who told the governess—and
then what an explosion! dragged off hither, without letting me even send my address to De
Mowbray. It is a fine thing to be a victim of cruelty at seventeen. And now as you are so
fond of giving advice, let me ask you why you are so very severe to that unfortunate
little man, your husband?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. What you call severity, arises from my strict sense of
propriety, of which I am sorry to say, Mr. Facile has not so strict a sense.</p>

<p>J<small>ULIA</small>. No! why for all I can see, the poor dear little man does nothing
but sit with his mathematical books before him all day, looking just like our geography
master. Then he is such a very easy man.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. The very thing I dread; he not only lets me have my own way, but
every one else too. He is the confidant of all the young ladies in the village; the very
servants ask his advice on every single point, and he gives it—is never affronted.</p>

<p>J<small>ULIA</small>. Dear, good-natured soul!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. There’s that Fanny Pepper has innumerable points to consult him
upon—a forward slut, who apes me in everything. If I wear ringlets, she wears
ringlets—makes her caps like mine. Now how do I know what she may ask him—and if he can
refuse nothing—think of that!</p>

<p>E<small>UCLID</small>. “X plus Y equal to—” Ah, my dear, what are you doing?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. Can you address me in that calm manner, after what I said this
morning about Fanny the housemaid?</p>

<p>E<small>UCLID</small>. True, my love, you did say something; but I don’t remember what
it was.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. Only been married three weeks—come down to spend the honeymoon
with your relation, Mr. Holdfast—and already the confidant of all the maid servants, and
don’t remember what I said!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>E<small>UCLID</small>. No, dear, I only remember the agreeable things you say.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. How provokingly good-tempered! I am cruelly used by your
indifference.</p>

<p>E<small>UCLID</small>. Are you? upon my word I did not mean it. I am not indifferent,
am always thinking of you—given, a, b.</p>

<p>F<small>ANNY</small>. Please ma’am, Miss—</p>

<p>E<small>UCLID</small>. Oh, I forgot! while I was out this morning, I bought this case
of drawing instruments for you—there, dear.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. And so, sir, you hope to atone for your conduct by a paltry

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. And does it make no impression?</p>

at present, independent of the lumps and bruises I have received.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. I can offer no other alternative. I cannot encourage your
addresses to Miss Julia; then I must consider my own character. Return into the basket,
and I will go and order the footmen to come up immediately.</p>

<p>R<small>ECK</small>. Well, madam, if there is no alternative, send me to this

one thing on your memory. Frances Pepper, next time you want a delicate affair managed,
hire a ticket porter.</p>

<p>F<small>ANNY</small>. Thank’ye, sir, thank’ye, sir, for throwing my basket out of

wanted to get out of the basket, but I told him I would have him carried out of the house.
You see I want to break off the connexion.</p>

<p>E<small>UCLID</small>. Studying, to be sure—a new subject—how to make bodies occupy the

you won’t care which way a book stands.</p>

<p>E<small>UCLID</small>. Ghost!</p>

<p>H<small>OLD</small>. Ha! ha! ha! talking about ghosts, I expect my friend Fable. You
will be delighted with Fable—a strange fellow, who thinks a legend is attached to every
house—a firm believer in ghosts, goblins, and all sorts of curiosities—and no wonder, for
he himself is a greater curiosity than all he believes in. But I hope we have not
interrupted your studies? We want your decision on a geographical discussion. I maintain
that Petersburgh is sixty degrees, north latitude—</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. Sixty-one and a half, my dear sir.</p>

<p>E<small>UCLID</small>. Sixty—</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. F. One and a half. Obstinate creature.</p>

<p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the punctuation and spelling of the
source text. Variant spellings have been retained, including “calender,” “terrestial,”
“accomodation,” and “dosing” (for “dozing”), as have inconsistent spellings such as
“lattitude” and “latitude.” Obvious errors have been corrected. The use of “its” and
“it’s” has been made consistent.</p>
